# Classic OS

Classic OS is an **economic operating system** for on-chain capital.

It provides a unified interface to:
- create capital,
- observe balances and positions,
- allocate resources,
- and form markets across blockchain networks.

Classic OS is designed to make complex on-chain activity **legible, structured, and intentional**.

## What Classic OS Is

Classic OS is not a single dApp or protocol.

It is an application layer that coordinates how users interact with:
- consensus systems (PoW, PoS),
- wallets and networks,
- capital deployment paths,
- and market formation primitives.

The focus is clarity over abstraction.

## Core Product Surfaces

Classic OS organizes activity around economic intent:

- **Produce** — create capital (e.g. mining, staking)
- **Portfolio** — view balances, positions, and activity
- **Deploy** — allocate capital into strategies
- **Markets** — create assets and form markets

Not all surfaces are fully available at all times.
Availability depends on network, consensus, and system state.

## Project Status

Classic OS is under active development.

Some modules are intentionally limited or scaffolded while the foundation is built.

The goal is a system that scales cleanly over time without losing coherence.
