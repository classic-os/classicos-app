# Classic OS User Journeys

## Purpose
Define the three primary user journeys that Classic OS enables through its integrated modules.

## Core User Journeys

### 1. Miner Journey (Using Mining OS)

**Goal:** Convert mined ETC into productive capital

```
Connect wallet
  ↓
Mining OS detects payouts (RPC-based detection logic)
  ↓
See earnings dashboard (custom-built UI)
  ↓
Strategy builder suggests: "Deploy 50% into yield" (DeFi automation)
  ↓
One-click execute strategy (execution engine)
  ↓
Monitor position health (real-time monitoring)
  ↓
Compound earnings automatically (automation rules)
```

**Key Features:**
- Mining dashboard with real-time earnings tracking
- Auto-detection of mining payouts
- Strategy templates optimized for mining income
- Direct pathway from earned ETC to yield opportunities

**Value:** Transforms mining into capital inflow source instead of capital exit vector.

### 2. Fiat User Journey (Using Brale Integration)

**Goal:** Enter ETC ecosystem from traditional finance

```
Open Classic OS
  ↓
Click "Add Funds"
  ↓
Brale ACH flow (business partner integration)
  ↓
USD → ETC Stablecoin (Brale minting)
  ↓
Browse yield opportunities (Portfolio + Deploy modules)
  ↓
Deploy into strategies (DeFi automation)
  ↓
Earn yield in stablecoin or ETC
```

**Key Features:**
- Fiat on-ramp via ACH integration (Brale)
- Circle USDC bridging (1:1 conversion)
- Stablecoin base pairs for yield strategies
- Seamless fiat → yield pathway

**Value:** Removes barrier to entry for retail users.

### 3. Multi-Chain User Journey (Using Multi-EVM Interface)

**Goal:** Migrate capital from other EVM chains to ETC

```
View portfolio across chains (multi-chain interface)
  ↓
See higher yields on ETC (opportunity showcase)
  ↓
Bridge assets (USDC → Brale stablecoin 1:1)
  ↓
Deploy into ETC DeFi strategies (DeFi automation)
  ↓
Capital stays in ETC ecosystem (retention via yield)
```

**Key Features:**
- Multi-chain portfolio view (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, etc.)
- ETC-specific opportunity showcase
- Cross-chain liquidity bridges with real-time rates
- Automated swap paths (CEX → Bridge → ETC DEX)

**Value:** Converts multi-chain users into ETC-native users by making transition frictionless.

## Implementation Sequencing

Journeys unlock progressively as capabilities are enabled:

**Phase 1 (Current):** Foundation
- Portfolio observation (read-only)
- Wallet connectivity
- Network switching

**Phase 2:** Mining OS
- Payout detection (RPC-based)
- Earnings tracking dashboard
- Mining → strategy recommendations

**Phase 3:** DeFi Automation
- Strategy builder (visual, no-code)
- Position health monitoring
- Automated execution engine

**Phase 4:** Full Integration
- Mining → strategies (complete loop)
- Brale → strategies (fiat → yield)
- Multi-chain → ETC (migration pathway)
